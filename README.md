# YouTube Clone

## Overview
This project is a clone of the YouTube home page, built using HTML and CSS. It replicates the core layout and design elements of YouTube, providing a familiar interface for browsing and viewing video thumbnails.

## Files
- **index.html**: The main HTML file containing the structure of the YouTube home page clone.
- **style.css**: The CSS file that styles the layout, header, navigation, and video sections.
- **assets/**: Contains images and icons used in the project.
- **screenshot/**: Contains screenshots of the project output.

## Project Building Process

1. **Setup Project Structure**  
   Created the basic folder structure with `index.html`, `style.css`, and an `assets` folder for images and icons.

2. **HTML Layout**  
   Built the HTML structure for the header, sidebar navigation, and main content area using semantic tags and divs.

3. **Styling with CSS**  
   Used Flexbox for responsive layouts. Styled the header, navigation, and video grid to closely match YouTube's design. Added hover effects and responsive adjustments.

4. **Assets Integration**  
   Added images and icons from the `assets` folder to represent video thumbnails, profile pictures, and the YouTube logo.

5. **Testing and Refinement**  
   Opened `index.html` in a browser to test the layout and appearance. Made adjustments to CSS for better alignment and responsiveness.

## Usage

- Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the YouTube home page clone.
